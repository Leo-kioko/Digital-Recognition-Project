1. Dataset Collection
Use a dataset like MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology), which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels), labeled from 0 to 9.
Each image is grayscale and already pre-labeled with the corresponding digit.
2. Preprocessing
Normalization: Rescale pixel values from [0, 255] to [0, 1] to improve the convergence of neural networks.
Resizing: If you use other datasets, ensure the images are resized to 28x28 pixels for consistency.
Flattening (for traditional ML models): Flatten the 2D image (28x28) into a 1D vector of 784 pixels for classifiers like SVM and Random Forest.
3. Feature Extraction
Raw Pixel Intensities: Simple but effective method for digit recognition.
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): A more advanced method that captures edge orientations, making it more robust for complex features.
4. Model Selection
Traditional Machine Learning Models:
Support Vector Machines (SVM): For smaller datasets and linear problems.
Random Forest: To capture complex relationships with an ensemble of decision trees.
Deep Learning Models:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): The most effective model for image classification tasks, particularly for digit recognition.
5. Model Training
Train the Model: Train using the extracted features from the images.
Metrics: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix for evaluation.
Fine-tuning: Hyperparameter tuning with techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to improve performance.
6. Deployment
Real-World Application: Deploy the trained model to recognize handwritten digits in real-time, perhaps integrating with web applications or mobile devices.
